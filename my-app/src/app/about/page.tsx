            I'm Brian Do, a product designer with over 5 years of experience,
            currently residing in Jakarta, Indonesia. I have a deep passion for
            crafting purposeful interfaces and products. My main goal is to
            bridge the divide between people and technology, transforming
            intricate challenges into meaningful and seamless experiences.

          More About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
          Brian Do holds a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a
          prestigious university in the United States and has a relentless drive
          for staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and design trends.
          Actively involved in the design community, Brian regularly
          participates in diverse design conferences and meetups. <br /> When
          he's not immersed in design work, he finds solace in playing the
          guitar and exploring new coffee shops in his local area. Brian firmly
          believes in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, making sure to
          take breaks and reenergize his creativity. In his spare time, he also
          volunteers at a local animal shelter on weekends.
